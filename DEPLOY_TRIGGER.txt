This file triggers a new Vercel deployment with the latest payment fix.

FINAL PAYMENT FIX: Production deployment missing latest stable Stripe API version.
Critical deployment needed with commit 6180a4d containing stable API version 2023-10-16.

STATUS: Payment system still failing with "An error occurred with our connection to Stripe"
ISSUE: Production deployment not reflecting latest code changes despite clean git status.

FORCE REBUILD: Need fresh deployment with stable Stripe API version 2023-10-16.
Previous deployments using unstable/invalid API versions causing payment failures.
