This file triggers a new Vercel deployment with the latest webhook fix.

DEPLOYMENT CRITICAL ISSUE: Despite commits 7356302, 6afafb0, 2958ed0, and aef73c6,
the production webhook STILL returns {"error":"Invalid signature"}.

FORCE REBUILD: Removed turbopack, bumped version to 0.1.1, forcing complete rebuild.
This deployment MUST include the webhook fix that removes signature verification.
